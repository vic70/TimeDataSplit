# This section defines the split condition for the data
splitCondition:
  channelmode: MODE_BHG2_Z # The channel mode for splitting the data
  splitmode: ff010001  # The channel mode's particular mode for the data splitting
  splitAtEnd: True  # Whether to split the data at the end or the start of the splitmode

# This section defines the range of data to be analyzed
data_range:
  ahead: 50  # The amount of time to analyze ahead of the trigger (in ms)
  behind: 200   # The amount of time to analyze behind the trigger (in ms)

# This section defines any conditional filtering for the data
condition:
  conditionExist: True  # Whether to apply a conditional filter to the data
  conditionalChannel: CMD_POS_BHG2_Z  # The channel to use for the conditional filter
  conditionValue: '<-70000'  # Only consider to split signal if split mode match AND conditional channel match the value

# This section defines any data conversion that needs to be applied
conversion:
  requireConversion: True  # Whether to apply a data conversion
  conversionChannel: WH_ADC_PORT_WAFERCOOLINGFLOWSNR_R  # The channel to convert
  newChannelName: Laser (um)  # The name of the new channel after conversion
  formula: '*0.03063'  # The formula to use for the conversion
  two_complement: False  # Whether to use two's complement for the conversion, suitable for ADC logging
